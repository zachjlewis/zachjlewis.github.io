Statement
======
Black Lives Matter. Stop Asian Hate. As a white male in a space historically and currently dominated by the same, I have an obligation to be both informed and an activisit for change. I'm dedicated to creating a space in physics and astronomy for marginalized identities and those less privileged than me. 

Resources
======
While learning about equity does not in and of itself create change, the first step towards making a difference is education. To that end, what follows are resources that I've found useful as I begin my journey in equity and inclusion.

Previous Work (at Pitt)
======

*Equity and Inclusion Committee*
I served as the undergraduate representative on the Pitt physics department's E&I committee and help to analyze departmental conditions and assist in faculty hiring. 
		
*Ultra-ViOLETS*
I was an active member of Ultra-ViOLETS (Ultra VIsibile Out LGBTQ+ Experimentalists, Theorists, and Staff), Pitt's physics LGBTQ+ club. 

*Society of Physics Students*
As a member of Pitt's SPS chapter, I helped to mentor underclass undergraduates and provide materials necessary to succeed in physics and astronomy. 
In 2020, this took the form of creating a "Physics Survival Guide" that included email templates to help new students inquire about research and introductory Python and Jupyter materials. 

*Women and Minorities in Physics*
WMP is a dedicated safe space for those who identify as as marginalized to discuss and propose changes within the department. As business manager of this club, I helped to supervise finances and communicate with governing bodies. I'm also an architect of their [website](https://sites.google.com/view/wmp-physics-pitt/home?authuser=0).
