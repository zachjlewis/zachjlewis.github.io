Statement
======
Black Lives Matter. Stop Asian Hate. As a white male in a space historically and currently dominated by the same, I have an obligation to be both informed and an activisit for change. I'm dedicated to creating a space in physics and astronomy for underrepresented minorities and those less privileged than me. 

Equity and Inclusion Committee
======
I serve as an undergraduate representative on the Pitt physics department's E&I committee and help to analyze departmental conditions and assist in faculty hiring. 
		
Ultra-ViOLETS
======
I am an active member of Ultra-ViOLETS (Ultra VIsibile Out LGBTQ+ Experimentalists, Theorists, and Staff), Pitt's physics LGBTQ+ club (find our Twitter that I run [here](https://twitter.com/uvioletspitt)). 

Society of Physics Students
======
As a member of Pitt's SPS chapter, I help to mentor underclass undergraduates and provide materials necessary to succeed in physics and astronomy. 
In 2020, this took the form of creating a "Physics Survival Guide" that included email templates to help new students inquire about research and introductory Python and 
Jupyter materials. As secretary, I serve as the liason between the other officers and the members of the club, and write emails to inform the club of opportunities and meetings.
	
Women and Minorities in Physics
======
WMP is a dedicated safe space for those who identify as as an underrepresented minority to discuss and propose 
changes within the department. As business manager of this club, I help to supervise finances and communicate with governing bodies. 
I'm also an architect of their [website](https://sites.google.com/view/wmp-physics-pitt/home?authuser=0).
