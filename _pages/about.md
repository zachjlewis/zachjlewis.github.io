I'm an undergraduate at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/), currently working with [Rachel Bezanson](https://rachelbezanson.github.io/) and [Brett Andrews](https://bretthandrews.github.io/) to investigate the mass-metallicity relation and its evolution at the intermediate redshift of z=0.8.
