{% include base_path %}

In my free time I like to read science fiction (Jemisin, Butler, and Okorafor are current favorites) and poetry (Siken is the way to go). I also like to build jigsaw puzzles (while watching HGTV), and bake desserts (especially pies). I'm an unabashed Star Wars fan, and comfort movies include Revenge of the Sith and Legally Blonde.
