ACORNS (Activities for Community OutReach iN STEM) works to build meaningful relationships between UW-Madison STEM departments and community centers in Dane County, Wisconsin. 

Studies show that feelings of belonging are the number one indicator of retention in STEM. The ability of students to see themselves in STEM spaces is crucial to building this sense of belonging. At the same time, students are only able to envision themselves as scientists inasmuch as they are doing science. 

We therefore take a two-pronged approach: first, community center members are invited onto campus to engage in department-hosted tours and programming–for example, seeing a show in the Astronomy Department Planetarium. Second, we visit each community center on a regular basis to facilitate highly interactive, tactile STEM-themed activities. These include modeling planet formation with ice cream and cookies, exploring stellar fusion with the ingredients of s’mores, and measuring the speed of light using a chocolate bar. 

This shift from a lecture-style format to a hands-on, student-led dialogue allows for an immersive STEM experience, highlighting both that science can be fun, accessible, and messy, but also that anyone is capable of doing it, regardless of expertise. Science is a state of mind, defined by curiosity–and every person has plenty of that. 

We welcome any and all feedback, suggestions, comments, ideas, and requests. Please email me! 

This project is currently supported by a Wisconsin Space Grant.
