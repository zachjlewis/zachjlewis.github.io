Mass-Metallicity Relation
======
For the past 2 years, I've been using the [LEGA-C](https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/home/legac/) spectroscopic survey to detail the high-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation and its evolution between z=0.8 and the current day. This project has been led by Brett Andrews and Rachel Bezanson, and assisted by Pitt undergraduate Katie Mack and then-high-school-student [Mariah Jones](https://www.today.com/tmrw/how-high-school-senior-mariah-jones-became-scientific-researcher-t211429).
